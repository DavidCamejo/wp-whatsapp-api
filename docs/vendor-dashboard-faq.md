A: Simply click the "Sync Products" button in the Product Synchronization section of your dashboard. The system will automatically gather your active products and submit them to your WhatsApp catalog.

### Q: Why are some of my products not appearing in my WhatsApp catalog?
A: Products may not appear due to:
1. Missing required information (images, price, or description)

3. WhatsApp catalog requirements not met (size limits, format issues)
4. Synchronization might still be in progress (can take up to 24 hours)

2. WhatsApp Business API accounts: Limits vary based on your plan

Your marketplace administrator can provide specific details about your account limits.

### Q: Why did my product sync fail?
A: Product synchronization may fail due to:
1. WhatsApp API connection issues
2. Product data not meeting WhatsApp requirements
3. Images too large or in unsupported formats
4. API rate limiting (too many requests in a short period)
5. Server timeout due to large catalog size

Check the error message in your activity logs for specific details.

## WhatsApp Settings
